Happy New Year, dear readers! Due to our busy travel schedule lately we were not posting much, but that is not to say
we have not been working on our Sling. While Sasha was in Germany, Peter finished the elevator and horizontal stabilizer;
and then we almost finished the vertical stabilizer assembly (would have finished it if not for the lack of the VOR antenna 
and wiring). Of course, that would not be possible without help from our friends! 
Jerry, Oleg, Sergey, Zina, and Mathias have joined us at various stages of the build. 

Ok, now to the description of what have we actually done.

Equipment used:
    - all the equipment descriped in [#priming](/tag/priming)
    - stainless steel rods sligtly smaller than the standard rivets (3.2, 4.0 and 4.8 mm), a pair of each size
    - deburring wheel to deburr rivets
    - milwakee M2650 rivet gun
    - hand drill and set of metric drill bits
    - 3/8'' drill bit
    - rivnut tool (link)
    - clecos (lots of them)
