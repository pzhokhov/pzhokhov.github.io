Hi this is Katya and I occasionally help the Sasha and Peter with plane stuff. However today was a very special day. She 
managed to pass the check ride with her examiner, The Lord decided to bless Sasha with guidance for a price.

An unfortunately large price, 
because we lost an important member of the team. Before we continue further, I would like to give a moment of 
silence for her iPad. Her examiner "puts away" her iPad on the floor, behind her huge pilot seat, then Sasha accidentally
murders it in a brief and final sweep by rolling the seat back. The examiner of course had the audacity to accuse her that it was
her fault, but I see it as a sacrifice for our benevolent, yet firm, blood thirsty Lord. Sasha finally paid the price, and
is now able to fly to any location she pleases. Hail The Lord.
