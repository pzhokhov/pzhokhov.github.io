title: Building a table
---

Eventually, we'll need a relatively large flat space to work on wings. We decided to bite the bullet and build a table rightaway. 

Claude let us use one of his tables, however, we wanted to build another one to have a large surface to work on the wings. So Sasha whipped out the plans 
for the EAA-recommended table, we made some small adjustments to make it compatible with the table Claude gave us
(so that we could, if we needed, connect them into a single 16 foot long table), and we went to Home Depot (we mentioned before that our hangar is right across the street from Home Depot, right? This came in real handy!). 

Here's the list of the adjustments we made: 

 - the table is 8 ft long instead of recommended 5. This means that the top long beams are 8 ft, and the bottom ones are 93 in.
 - the top surface is also 8 ft long (which is, conveniently, the length of the standard plywood sheet sold in home depot)
 - the top surface is not flush at the front, but has a small overhang - we did it to be able to attach clamps to it. Otherwise,
   one has to clamp things to the top beam and the top surface together, which requires a minimum of 5 inch gap from the clamp.
