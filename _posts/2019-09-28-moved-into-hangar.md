title: Moved into the hangar with Claude!
---

Up until today, all the parts of the empennage and wing kits were sitting in our one bedroom apartment in Millbrae. Today, they have finally found home
in the hangar. 

About half a year ago, we went to the local EAA meeting in San Carlos airport, and learnt that we are not the only ones building Sling TSi in the Bay Area. 
In fact, our fellow builder Claude Pignol is not only building Sling, but also looking for another builder to split his hangar in Hayward airport with.
This worked out for us very well. The hangar has a lot of space and is right next to the airfield (this was the first question everyone asked when learning that we are working on the airplane in the apartment - where are you going to take off and land?); there is a home depot right across the street from the hangar, and it is almost bartable (so we both can get there after work relatively easily)
But, most importantly, Claude is super experienced (has built and flown airplanes for many years), and is way ahead of us in the construction process, and helps us a lot! 
Did I already mention how cool Claude is? He also lets us use his tools, which he has many! Also, given the fact that we are the ones with the blog, us moving in with Claude is very reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes / Dr. Watson situation :) 


Anyways today is the day we officially move in! 
We gathered our special moving forces (good friends Steph and Fred who are each likely strong enough to lift the entire airplane with one hand), 
and dumped all the parts in a u-haul.
 We had to go with the giant 24 foot one, because the spars are 13 ft long, so the smallest truck they can fit in is 17 ft (the 13 ft truck has 13 ft from attic to the back door, so we would have had to suspend the spars from the attic), and 
at any rate the closest uhaul shop to us had only one truck left for that day :/. Peter had to drive it and was freaking out the whole way. He also bumped the truck a little bit in one of the first floor balconies (there was not enough clearance), but otherwise, the drive went rather uneventfully.
