title: Finished deburring and scotchbriting horizontal stabilizer parts
---

Today we finished preparing all horizontal stabilizer parts! 

Yes, yes, horizontal stabilizer is the first assmebly, has the smallest number of parts etc, but we are still proud :) 
We deburred all the parts (some of this we have actually done before, i.e. before moving to the hangar). 
For deburring, we were using the swivel tool for the holes and inner edges, and scotchbrite grinder wheel for outer edges.

As we would like to prime everything, we also scotchbrited all surfaces.  We were using battery-powered craftsman detail sander (picked by Peter mostly for battery compatibility with our craftsman drill) with scotchbrite vecro'd to the bottom for large surfaces

For areas to tight to get to with craftsman sander we got a ryobi tiny detail sander. Now, ryobi sander assumes the sticky surface is on 
the sand paper; and scotchbrite pads are not sticky. Solution? Double sided sticky tape!

There are places where one cannot get even with ryobi, those we had to scotchbrite by hand. 

The plan for priming is now that right before priming, we will scotchbrite the parts one more time, then clean them with acetone, and then prime.
Some parts also need to be dimpled before that.
