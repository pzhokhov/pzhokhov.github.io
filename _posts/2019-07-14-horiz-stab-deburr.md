title: "Horizontal stabilizer: deburring"
---

Time: 8 person-hrs. As a first step of working on the horizontal stabilizer, we went through and deburred all the parts. 

For most of the parts in the horizontal stabilizer assembly, burrs were rather small, so a bit of scoth-briting was sufficient. 
When it was not, we used swivel-type deburring tools to cut off the larger burrs:

Surprizingly, this took quite a bit of time (this was suprizing to us because through deburring is mentioned in the 
introduction manual, and yet not mentioned in any of the blogs we read). 

Eventually, the parts become smooth and pleasant to touch
