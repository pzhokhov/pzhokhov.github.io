Our airplane landed for the first time! We decided to keep it a glider for now (without engine) and focus on the panel.

Lately, our friends are helping us a lot! Last two weeks we made a concentrated push to finish the side skins attachement.
Sarah, Eugene, Brandon, and Joost together pulled probably a thousand rivets in the side skins and on the belly of the plane.

Brandon even got to sign the inward-facing portions of the side skins:

Not all the rivets went in perfectly smoothly, and some rivet holes had to be clear-drilled. Notable mentions are 
rivets in the tail -- top side row of rivets is rather mismatched (an issue pointed out by Claude as well and other builders),
Rivets in the very tip of the tail, where metal parts are curved, were also a bit misaligned and needed clear-drilling.

After that, the airplane was ready to land and stand on its own two wheels! We delayed the landing one session because
Peter wanted to make sure match-drilling the back plates of wheel fairings does not require taking the wheels off, and it did not.

Landing the airplane (or, rather, taking it off from existing supports) is an affair that requires at least three people
(or a crane), as two people can lift the airplane by the landing gear legs, and the third needs to
(promptly, as the first two are quickly getting tired of holding) remove supports.

After the landing, the airplane hosted its first passenger

With the jigs in place, there is not much legroom. Running joke is that it is still Economy Basic,
to qualify for Economy Comfort one needs to put in more build hours.

We decided to keep the engine off for now, and focus on the panel. Without the engine, accessing the panel
is quite easy -- we can reach through the front (where firewall would be).

Imitating Midwest Panel Builders, we are also making a shelf for the avionics.
It will be supported by center console in the middle, and by special supports attached to the panel rib from the sides.
We made the shelf itself by cutting up the wing jigs. We are not quite done making the supports, stay tuned for further 
updates on the shelf; but here's a picture of Peter showing how avionics will be held by the shelf:
