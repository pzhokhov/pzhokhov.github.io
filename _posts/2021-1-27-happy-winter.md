This week, we finally catch up to blogging and airplane building! We start closing the right wing! We meet new builders! 

Its an exciting time, readers. A new year is upon us. We anticipate receiving our fuselage kit in March, and so have resumed airplane building with a will. We hope to have our wings painted by the time we receive our fuselage. This necessitates a number of things, including choosing a paint scheme and closing the wing :) Meanwhile, all we've been working on during break is buying a nice plant for my dad...

and building a new 3d printer!

Before that though, we worked very hard. Here I am, sealing the left fuel tank:

And my family came and helped...

And even our buddy Luke came! Before he moved to LA to join the same company as our buddy Kevin.

But that silliness is all behind us. We have become very serious builders now. On Sunday we met new builders Yeol and Chad, regaling them with our very serious stories about airplane building. They patiently listened to us, which was very nice of them, and its always great to meet new builders!

In terms of serious tips/tricks, one thing we've been considering is the significance of [this](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_20-138D.pdf) advisory circular. It has specific guidance for ground and flight testing IFR GPS installations and seems like something we should pay attention to, but I've never seen any other builders discuss it. Thoughts, guys? Do you plan to flight test your GPS or play it by ear?

Happy new year! Here's to more blog posts and Sling fun in 2021 :)
